                What do I do?
            </h6>

            <p>
                I build software, specifically web applications. I used to be very passionate about coding and this sort
                of
                stuff. Now I'm just doing it for a living. Though I still enjoy crafting my side projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                I often play games, mostly single-player games. I'm not a competitive person. I play games to relax and
                enjoy.
                My favorite genres are RPG and Strategy. Some examples are Divinity Original Sin 2, Company of Heroes
                Series,
                and Total War Series.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am also interested in philosophy. I find Nihilism and Absurdism to be very interesting and relatable.
                I'm not
                a hardcore philosopher; I just enjoy reading and thinking about it. Maybe this is why I lost my passion
                for
                coding, haha.
